This tool transforms text in a few steps:

1. Lowercase Conversion: It first converts all characters in your input text to lowercase.

2. Space to Hyphen: Any spaces ( ) in the text are then replaced with hyphens (-).

3. Period to Hyphen: Similarly, any periods (.) are also replaced with hyphens (-).

4. Consolidate Hyphens: If the previous steps result in multiple consecutive hyphens (e.g., hello--world), these are consolidated into a single hyphen (hello-world).

5. Remove Edge Hyphens: Finally, any hyphens at the very beginning
